Having 5 long hair cats & 1 husband the amount of filth, hair etc that this brings out of the carpets everytime is amazing. I don't know whether I shld be proud or ashamed of how filthy my carpets were. All the attachments are sensible and work, even the small hand-held toy is very useful. I can't find fault with it - I love my machine! A woman must have been involved with the design as no man could come up with such a good product.Well done Bissell!!!",

The woman at the check-out looked at the reservation details & said \"\"Ah yes, the potato set you ordered?\"\" to which I replied - \"\"Well it's a very expensive potato set!\"\". Seriously, this patio set is brilliant value at the offer price - we saw a similar but smaller table with only 2 chairs at a nearby store for the same price as this complete set! The weather has been pretty bad since we bought it so not actually used it yet, but very pleased with it so far.",

The product was excellant and gives the wife more than twice as much line - no I will not get a bigger washing machine. Wife happy - me happy, that's life!",

The only dowside to the product was that there are two open window spaces which have no shutters on them enabling cats to get inside and urinate in the house. Im not sure if this problem would have been solved if these spaces had also had windows which could have been shut.",

It's very easy to assemble with the base inside the butt on purchase. My only criticism (and it's minor) is that the base (stand) doesn't hold together that well until you place the butt on it - then - when it rains, the weight of the water holds it more securely. It's a good product and doesn't take up very much room so when I look out of the window down the garden, it isn't the focus of my attention.",
